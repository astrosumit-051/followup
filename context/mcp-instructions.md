# Claude Code MCP Server Integration Guide

## Purpose
This file instructs Claude Code to leverage specific MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers throughout the webapp development lifecycle. These servers provide specialized capabilities that enhance code generation, testing, security, design implementation, and problem-solving.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Always consider which MCP server best serves the current task.** Don't reinvent capabilities that MCP servers already provide. Use these tools proactively to:
- Gather current information
- Validate security
- Automate testing
- Access design context
- Structure complex problem-solving

---

## Available MCP Servers & When to Use Them

### 1. **Ref** (`ref`) ‚≠ê PRIMARY DOCUMENTATION SOURCE
**Purpose:** Token-efficient documentation search to stop hallucinations with accurate, up-to-date technical documentation

**Tools Available:**
- `ref_search_documentation`: Search through 1000s of technical docs (APIs, frameworks, libraries, services)
- `ref_read_url`: Read full web page content with smart chunking
- `ref_search_web`: Fallback web search for broader queries

**Key Features:**
- **Token Efficiency**: Returns only the most relevant 200-5000 tokens instead of entire pages (e.g., Figma API is 80k tokens, Ref returns just the ~200 you need)
- **Smart Chunking**: Pre-chunks documentation to avoid context bloat
- **Session Awareness**: Never returns duplicate results in the same session
- **Deep Linking**: Provides exact documentation section links for verification
- **Documentation-Optimized**: Loads all code tabs, syntax examples, and interactive elements
- **Covers 1000s of Sources**: Public GitHub repos, official docs sites, and all major platforms/libraries

**Use Cases:**
- Looking up API parameters and methods
- Finding framework-specific patterns and best practices
- Checking library versions and breaking changes
- Understanding service configuration and setup
- Getting exact syntax for unfamiliar APIs
- Validating implementation approaches
- Reading README files and getting started guides

**When to Trigger:**
- Working with any external API, library, or framework
- User asks "how do I use X"
- Need to check API documentation
- Implementing features with unfamiliar tools
- Debugging API integration issues
- Before making assumptions about API behavior

**Why Ref Over General Search:**
```
Context Efficiency:
- Standard web fetch: 20k+ tokens (mostly irrelevant)
- Ref: 200-5000 tokens (highly relevant)
- Cost savings: ~$0.09 per step with Opus
- Less context = smarter model responses

Accuracy Benefits:
- Documentation-specific crawler
- Always up-to-date information
- Deep links to exact sections
- No hallucinated API signatures
```

**Best Practice:**
```
1. Use Ref FIRST before implementing any external API integration
2. Search for specific endpoints/methods, not general topics
3. Read returned URLs for detailed implementation examples
4. Combine with Exa for code examples from real projects

CRITICAL: Always use Ref instead of relying on memory for:
- API signatures and parameters
- Configuration options
- Framework-specific patterns
- Library methods and classes
```

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Search Ref for Stripe subscription creation API documentation"
"Find the latest Supabase auth configuration options"
"Look up Next.js 15 server actions best practices in the docs"
"Get the exact parameters for Figma's REST API comment endpoint"
"Search Vercel Edge Functions rate limits and configuration"
"How do I configure tRPC with Next.js App Router?"
"What are the Prisma schema syntax for relations?"
```

---

### 2. **Brave Search** (`brave-search`)

- Need to verify framework versions or breaking changes beyond docs
- Looking for blog posts, tutorials, or community solutions
- Debugging issues that require Stack Overflow context
- Finding news, announcements, or release notes

**Note:** Prefer **Ref** for official documentation. Use Brave for broader web search, community content, and real-time information.

**Example Prompts:**
```
"Search for the latest Next.js 15 App Router authentication patterns"
"Find current React Server Components best practices"
"Look up TypeScript 5.4 new features and migration guide"

## Integration Best Practices

### 1. **Proactive Tool Usage**
Don't wait for explicit permission to use MCP tools. If the task clearly benefits from a specific server, use it:
- **Ref**: For ANY technical documentation (PRIMARY - use this first)
- Brave/Exa: For broader web search and research
- Semgrep: For all security-sensitive code
- Playwright: For critical user flows
- GitHub: For repository operations
- Sequential Thinking: For complex planning
<!-- - Figma: When design links are provided -->

### 2. **Documentation Priority**
When looking up technical information, follow this hierarchy:
```
1. Ref (Official docs, APIs, frameworks) ‚Üê START HERE
2. Exa (Code examples from real projects)
3. Brave (Community content, tutorials, blog posts)
```
**Never hallucinate API signatures or configuration options - always check Ref first.**

### 2. **Tool Chaining**
Combine multiple MCP servers for comprehensive solutions:

```
Example: Building a new authenticated feature with Stripe
1. Ref ‚Üí Look up Stripe API subscription documentation
2. Sequential Thinking ‚Üí Plan architecture
3. Ref ‚Üí Check Next.js auth patterns documentation
4. Exa ‚Üí Find real Stripe + Next.js integration examples
5. GitHub ‚Üí Check existing auth implementation in repo
6. [Generate Code]
7. Semgrep ‚Üí Scan for vulnerabilities
8. Playwright ‚Üí Create E2E tests
```

### 3. **Context Preservation**
When using Sequential Thinking or complex workflows:
- Document intermediate decisions
- Explain reasoning for tool choices
- Maintain state across tool calls
- Reference previous analysis when making decisions

### 4. **Security-First Approach**
```
ALWAYS run Semgrep on:
- Authentication/authorization code
- Database query construction
- API endpoints handling user input
- File upload/download functionality
- Any code dealing with secrets or credentials
```

### 5. **Design System Consistency**
When Figma MCP is available:
- Always extract design tokens before coding
- Use Code Connect mappings when available
- Reference existing components from design system
- Validate implementations match design specifications
