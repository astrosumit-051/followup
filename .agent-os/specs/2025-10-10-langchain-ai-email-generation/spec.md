> Spec: LangChain Integration & AI Email Template Generation
> Created: 2025-10-10
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement AI-powered email generation system using LangChain with multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok). The system will generate personalized email templates based on contact context, conversation history, and relationship data, providing both formal and casual style options for immediate follow-up communication.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Generate AI Email Template from Contact Context

As a busy professional who just met someone at a networking event, I want the AI to automatically generate a personalized follow-up email based on the notes I captured about our conversation, so that I can send timely, contextual outreach without spending 30 minutes crafting each message.

**Workflow:**
1. User navigates to contact detail page
2. User clicks "Generate Email" button
3. System analyzes contact data (name, company, role, notes, priority)
4. AI generates two template options (formal and casual)
5. User reviews both templates, selects preferred style
6. User can edit the template or use as-is
7. Template is saved for sending or further refinement

**Problem Solved:** Eliminates the blank page syndrome and writer's block that prevents timely follow-up. Transforms 30-minute email writing tasks into 2-minute review-and-send workflows.

### Story 2: AI Context Building from Conversation History

As a consultant maintaining relationships with 100+ clients, I want the AI to remember all previous email exchanges with each contact, so that follow-up emails naturally reference past conversations and avoid repeating information or asking redundant questions.

**Workflow:**
1. User sends email through RelationHub
2. System stores email content in conversation history
3. On next email generation, AI retrieves conversation context
4. Generated emails reference previous discussions naturally
5. AI avoids repeating past topics or questions
6. Follow-ups feel personalized and relationship-aware

**Problem Solved:** Prevents embarrassing situations like asking the same questions twice, forgetting what was discussed, or sending generic emails that ignore relationship history.

### Story 3: Multi-Provider LLM Reliability

As a power user sending 20+ emails daily, I want the system to automatically fallback to alternative AI providers when the primary service is rate-limited or down, so that my workflow never gets blocked by API issues.

**Workflow:**
1. User requests AI email generation
2. System attempts OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo (primary)
3. If rate limited or error, automatically falls back to Anthropic Claude
4. If both fail, queues request for retry
5. User receives generated email without awareness of provider switching
6. System logs provider usage for monitoring

**Problem Solved:** Eliminates frustrating "AI unavailable" errors and ensures consistent user experience regardless of underlying infrastructure issues.

## Spec Scope

1. **LangChain Integration Module** - Create NestJS module with LangChain setup, supporting OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, Anthropic Claude Sonnet, and future Grok API integration with automatic provider fallback chain.

2. **Email Generation Service** - Implement AI service that generates personalized email templates by analyzing contact data (name, company, role, notes, priority, birthday, gender) and conversation history, producing both formal and casual style options.

3. **Prompt Template System** - Build configurable prompt template management with version control, supporting email generation, follow-up reminders, and style transformation prompts with variable substitution.

4. **Conversation History Storage** - Create database schema and service for storing all sent emails and AI-generated content, enabling context-aware email generation that references past interactions.

5. **GraphQL API for Email Generation** - Implement mutations (`generateEmailTemplate`, `saveEmail`) and queries (`getEmail`, `listEmails`, `getConversationHistory`) with user authorization and rate limiting.

6. **LLM Response Caching** - Implement Redis-based caching layer for LLM responses (1-hour TTL) to reduce API costs and improve response times for similar prompts.

7. **Security & Rate Limiting** - Implement Semgrep scanning for prompt injection vulnerabilities, input sanitization, and rate limiting (10 requests/minute per user) to prevent abuse and excessive API costs.

## Out of Scope

- Rich text email composition interface (separate spec)
- Gmail/Outlook OAuth integration (separate spec)
- Email sending functionality (separate spec)
- Email templates library UI (separate spec)
- Polish Draft feature with 4 style options (separate spec - builds on this foundation)
- Resume attachment feature (separate spec)
- Email tracking pixel implementation (Phase 4)
- Advanced AI personalization with user writing style learning (Phase 5)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Backend AI Generation Working** - User can call GraphQL mutation to generate AI email template for any contact, receiving both formal and casual style options within 5 seconds.

2. **Multiple LLM Providers Functional** - System successfully uses OpenAI as primary provider, automatically falls back to Anthropic when needed, with provider switching transparent to users.

3. **Conversation History Tracked** - All generated and sent emails are stored in database with timestamps, enabling AI to retrieve context for subsequent email generation.

4. **Security Scan Passed** - Semgrep scan completes with zero critical prompt injection vulnerabilities, all inputs properly sanitized, and rate limiting preventing abuse.

5. **80%+ Test Coverage** - Unit tests for LangChain service, integration tests for email generation workflow, and E2E API tests for GraphQL mutations all passing with comprehensive coverage.
