# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Contact CRUD Operations

## Overview

Implement complete contact management functionality allowing authenticated users to create, read, update, and delete professional contacts with rich contextual data. This is the foundational feature that enables users to build and organize their professional network within Cordiq.

## User Stories

### Primary Contact Management

As a Cordiq user, I want to add new professional contacts with comprehensive information (name, email, phone, LinkedIn, company, role, notes), so that I can build a detailed database of my professional network.

**Workflow:**
1. User navigates to contacts section or clicks "Quick Add" from dashboard
2. User fills out contact form with all relevant fields
3. System validates data and creates contact
4. User sees success confirmation and can view the new contact

**Problem Solved:** Users currently have no way to store and organize their professional contacts within the platform. This feature provides the core data entry mechanism.

### Contact Organization & Prioritization

As a user managing a large professional network, I want to assign priority levels (High/Medium/Low) to my contacts, so that I can focus on the most important relationships.

**Workflow:**
1. User views their contact list
2. User sees priority indicators for each contact
3. User can sort/filter by priority level
4. User can update priority from contact detail view

**Problem Solved:** Without prioritization, all contacts are treated equally, making it difficult to focus on key relationships. This enables strategic network management.

### Contact Discovery & Access

As a user with many contacts, I want to quickly search and filter my contact list by various criteria (name, company, industry, priority), so that I can find specific contacts efficiently.

**Workflow:**
1. User enters search query in contacts page
2. System filters results in real-time
3. User applies additional filters (priority, company, industry)
4. User clicks on contact to view full details

**Problem Solved:** As contact databases grow, finding specific people becomes time-consuming. Advanced search enables rapid contact discovery.

## Spec Scope

1. **Contact Creation** - GraphQL mutation to create new contacts with full field validation and user authorization
2. **Contact Retrieval** - GraphQL queries to fetch single contact by ID and paginated list of user's contacts with search/filter capabilities
3. **Contact Updates** - GraphQL mutation to update any contact field with validation and authorization checks
4. **Contact Deletion** - GraphQL mutation to soft delete or permanently remove contacts with cascade handling
5. **Frontend Forms** - React forms with validation for creating and editing contacts using React Hook Form and Zod
6. **Contact List View** - Paginated table/grid view with sorting, filtering, and search functionality
7. **Contact Detail View** - Comprehensive single-contact page displaying all information with edit capability

## Out of Scope

- Profile picture upload (deferred to separate feature)
- LinkedIn profile scraping (Phase 3 feature)
- Contact import/export (Phase 3 feature)
- Tag management (will be separate spec)
- Activity tracking integration (future iteration)
- Email composition from contact view (Phase 2 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Backend**: User can create, read, update, and delete contacts via GraphQL API with proper authorization
2. **Frontend**: User can navigate to `/contacts`, see their contact list, add new contacts via form, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts
3. **Testing**: All CRUD operations have comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests with 80%+ coverage
4. **UI**: Contact forms follow design principles and are fully responsive across desktop and mobile viewports
