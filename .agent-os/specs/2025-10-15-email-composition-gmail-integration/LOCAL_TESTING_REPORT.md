## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug #1: TipTap SSR Hydration Error ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Console errors on page load

**Error Message:**
```
Warning: Prop `className` did not match. Server: "..." Client: "..."
```

**Root Cause:**
TipTap rich text editor was rendering during server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js, causing hydration mismatches between server and client HTML.

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `apps/web/components/email/EmailComposer.tsx`
- Line: 54-55
- Added `immediatelyRender: false` to TipTap `useEditor` configuration
- This disables SSR rendering and forces client-side only rendering

**Verification:**
✅ Page loads without hydration warnings
✅ Editor renders correctly on client side
✅ No console errors related to TipTap

---

### Bug #2: GraphQL Parameter Order - Circular JSON Serialization ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** High (Blocking)
**Impact:** Template Library modal completely broken

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to load templates: Converting circular structure to JSON
--> starting at object with constructor 'SupabaseAuthClient'
| property 'mfa' -> object with constructor 'Object'
| property 'webauthn' -> object with constructor 'WebAuthnApi'
--- property 'client' closes the circle
```

**Root Cause:**
All 4 GraphQL wrapper functions in `apps/web/lib/graphql/email-templates.ts` were passing parameters to `graphqlRequest`/`graphqlMutation` in the **wrong order**.

**Expected Signature:**
```typescript
graphqlRequest(query: string, variables?: object, supabaseClient?: SupabaseClient)
```

**Actual (Wrong):**
```typescript
graphqlRequest(supabaseClient, query, variables)  // ❌ Incorrect order
```

This caused the Supabase client object (which has circular references) to be passed as the `query` parameter. TanStack Query attempted to serialize it for caching/debugging, triggering the circular JSON error.

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `apps/web/lib/graphql/email-templates.ts`
- Fixed all 4 functions:
  1. **`getEmailTemplates`** (Lines 142-151)
     - Before: `graphqlRequest(supabase, GET_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_QUERY)`
     - After: `graphqlRequest(GET_EMAIL_TEMPLATES_QUERY, undefined, supabase)`

  2. **`createEmailTemplate`** (Lines 176-187)
     - Before: `graphqlMutation(supabase, CREATE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_MUTATION, { input })`
     - After: `graphqlMutation(CREATE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_MUTATION, { input }, supabase)`

  3. **`updateEmailTemplate`** (Lines 206-218)
     - Before: `graphqlMutation(supabase, UPDATE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_MUTATION, { id, input })`
     - After: `graphqlMutation(UPDATE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_MUTATION, { id, input }, supabase)`

  4. **`deleteEmailTemplate`** (Lines 234-245)
     - Before: `graphqlMutation(supabase, DELETE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_MUTATION, { id })`
     - After: `graphqlMutation(DELETE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_MUTATION, { id }, supabase)`

**Verification:**
✅ Template Library modal opens successfully
✅ Displays 1 template with proper formatting
✅ No circular JSON errors in console
✅ Load, Edit, Delete buttons functional
✅ Screenshot saved: `.playwright-mcp/page-2025-10-29T03-04-15-706Z.png`

---

### Bug #3: Webpack Cache Corruption ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Development server startup failures

**Error Message:**
```
Failed to load SWC binary for darwin/arm64
```

**Root Cause:**
Manually deleting `.next` directory without clearing other related caches (Turbo cache, node_modules/.cache) caused webpack/SWC cache inconsistencies.

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Complete cache cleanup sequence
rm -rf .next
rm -rf .turbo
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

**Verification:**
✅ Development servers start successfully
✅ Both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 4000) running
✅ Hot module replacement (HMR) working
✅ No SWC binary errors

**Prevention:**
Always use the complete cache cleanup sequence when encountering build issues, rather than just deleting `.next` alone.

---

### Bug #4: Polish Draft Button State Synchronization ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** Low (UI/UX Issue)
**Impact:** Button remained disabled despite editor containing text

**Issue Description:**
After typing text into the TipTap editor, the "Polish Draft" button remained disabled even though the editor contained content. The button should have been enabled as soon as text was entered.

**Root Cause:**
The `disabled` prop on the "Polish Draft" button was directly calling `editor.getText().trim()` to check if content exists. This approach doesn't trigger a React re-render when the editor content changes, because TipTap's `getText()` method is not a React state value.

**Code Before Fix:**
```typescript
<Button
  disabled={!editor.getText().trim()}  // ❌ Not reactive
>
  Polish Draft
</Button>
```

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `apps/web/components/email/EmailComposer.tsx`
- Added React state to track editor content: `const [hasEditorContent, setHasEditorContent] = useState(!!initialContent)`
- Updated TipTap's `onUpdate` callback to set state when content changes:
  ```typescript
  onUpdate: ({ editor }) => {
    const content = editor.getHTML();
    const hasContent = editor.getText().trim().length > 0;
    setHasEditorContent(hasContent);  // ✅ Updates React state
    if (onContentChange) {
      onContentChange(content);
    }
  }
  ```
- Updated button's `disabled` prop to use state: `disabled={!hasEditorContent}`
- Also updated "Save as Template" button to use the same state
- Updated `handlePolishedVersionSelect` and `handleLoadTemplate` to set state when content is loaded

**Verification:**
✅ Typed text into editor: "Testing the Polish Draft button fix. This text should enable the button."
✅ "Polish Draft" button became enabled immediately after text was entered
✅ Button is now clickable (shows `cursor=pointer`, no `[disabled]` attribute)
✅ State synchronization works correctly
✅ "Save as Template" button also benefits from the same fix

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/web/components/email/EmailComposer.tsx` (Lines 51, 73-82, 95-103, 105-122, 328, 343)

### 8. Polish Draft Modal ⚠️ SKIPPED

**Reason:** Requires AI service (OpenRouter/OpenAI API)

**Known Issue:**
After typing text into the TipTap editor, the "Polish Draft" button remained disabled despite editor containing text.

**Root Cause:**
State synchronization issue with TipTap's `getText()` method not triggering React re-render to update the button's disabled state.

**Testing Strategy:**
Skipped this feature because:
1. Testing would require fixing the state synchronization issue
2. Feature requires actual API calls to OpenRouter/OpenAI (non-mocked)
3. Making real API calls during local testing would consume API credits
4. Feature can be tested in staging environment with proper API credentials

**Status:** Non-blocking - other features prioritized for local testing

---

### 9. File Upload / Attachments ⚠️ DEFERRED TO STAGING

**Reason:** Requires AWS S3 integration with presigned URLs

**Components Not Tested:**
- File upload drag-and-drop zone
- AWS S3 presigned URL generation
- File upload progress
- Attachment display and deletion

**Testing Strategy:**
These features will be tested in staging environment with:
- Production AWS S3 bucket configured
- Presigned URL generation endpoint working
- Actual file uploads to S3

---

### 10. Gmail OAuth Integration ⚠️ DEFERRED TO STAGING

**Reason:** Requires production Gmail OAuth credentials

**Components Not Tested:**
- Gmail OAuth login flow
- OAuth popup window
- Token encryption and storage
- Automatic token refresh
- Connection status monitoring
- Disconnect functionality
- Actual email sending via Gmail API

**Testing Strategy:**
These features will be tested in staging environment with:
- Production Gmail OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Gmail API access configured
- Real email sending verification

---

## Console Log Analysis

### No Errors Found ✅

**Console Messages:**
- Only React DevTools info messages (non-blocking)
- No errors related to:
  - Template loading
  - Contact search/filtering
  - GraphQL requests
  - State management
