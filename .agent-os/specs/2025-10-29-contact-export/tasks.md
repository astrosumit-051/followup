## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies

**Sequential Dependencies:**
- Task 1 must complete before Task 2 (database schema required for service)
- Task 2 must complete before Tasks 3 & 4 (service layer required for APIs)
- Tasks 3 & 4 can run in parallel (independent API implementations)
- Tasks 5, 6, 7 can start after Task 3 completes (frontend needs GraphQL)
- Task 8 must wait for all previous tasks (E2E tests need full system)
- Task 9 can run in parallel with Task 8
- Task 10 is final cleanup and documentation

### Estimated Time per Task

1. Database Schema & Migration: **4 hours**
2. Backend Service Layer: **8 hours**
3. GraphQL API: **4 hours**
4. REST API: **3 hours**
5. Frontend Export Dialog: **6 hours**
6. Frontend Export Button Integration: **2 hours**
7. Frontend Export History: **4 hours**
8. End-to-End Testing: **6 hours**
9. Security & Performance: **3 hours**
10. Documentation & Finalization: **2 hours**

**Total Estimated Time:** 42 hours (~5 working days)

### Testing Strategy

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach:**
- Write tests FIRST for each major component (steps 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 7.1, 8.1-8.8)
- Implement functionality to make tests pass
- Refactor code while keeping tests green
- Verify all tests pass at the end of each major task

**Test Coverage Goals:**
- Unit tests: Service methods, utility functions
- Integration tests: GraphQL resolvers, REST controllers
- Component tests: React components with React Testing Library
- E2E tests: Full user workflows with Playwright
- Target: 85%+ overall coverage

### Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- PostgreSQL database running (Docker Compose)
- Redis running (for caching, if needed)
- All npm dependencies installed
- Prisma CLI available

**Development Commands:**
```bash
# Run database migration
pnpm prisma migrate dev

# Start development servers
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test               # All tests
pnpm test:unit          # Unit tests only
pnpm test:integration   # Integration tests only
pnpm test:e2e          # E2E tests only
pnpm test:cov          # Coverage report

# Run Semgrep scan
semgrep --config auto apps/api/src/contacts/contact-export.*
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **CSV Escaping:** Don't forget to escape commas, quotes, and newlines in CSV fields
2. **Excel Date Formatting:** Use proper Excel date type, not string representation
3. **Filename Sanitization:** Always sanitize user-provided filenames to prevent path traversal
4. **Memory Management:** Stream large files instead of loading entire file into memory
5. **Authorization:** Always verify userId from JWT matches contact ownership
6. **File Download:** Ensure proper Content-Disposition header for browser download
7. **Error Handling:** Provide user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
8. **Test Flakiness:** Use fixed dates/times in tests, avoid randomness

### Success Criteria

**Feature is complete when:**
- âœ… All 10 tasks completed and checked off
- âœ… All tests passing (unit + integration + E2E)
- âœ… Test coverage â‰¥ 85%
- âœ… Semgrep security scan passes with 0 critical findings
- âœ… Performance target met (<5s for 1000 contacts)
- âœ… User can successfully export contacts in both CSV and Excel formats
- âœ… User can view export history in Settings
- âœ… Code reviewed and approved
- âœ… Merged to phase-3 branch

### Next Steps After Completion

1. Manual QA testing in development environment
2. Deploy to staging environment for testing
3. User acceptance testing (UAT)
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor for errors and performance issues
6. Gather user feedback for improvements
