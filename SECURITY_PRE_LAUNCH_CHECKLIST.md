  - [ ] Authorization denials (403 errors with context)
  - [ ] Draft/signature deletion operations
  - [ ] S3 upload/download/delete operations
  - [ ] Password reset attempts
  - [ ] OAuth token operations
- [ ] Implement privacy safeguards (no PII in logs)
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Update `SECURITY.md` documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All security events properly logged with timestamps
- No PII exposure in logs
- CloudWatch integration ready (can be enabled via env var)
- Performance impact < 5ms per log entry
- Audit log table with proper indexes

**References:**
- Complete implementation plan in Issue #36

## ‚úÖ Already Implemented

### [x] Helmet.js HTTP Security Headers

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - No action needed!
**Location:** `apps/api/src/main.ts` (lines 32-57)

**Implemented Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ Content Security Policy (CSP) - protects against XSS
- ‚úÖ HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) - enforces HTTPS (1 year max-age)
- ‚úÖ Frameguard - prevents clickjacking attacks
- ‚úÖ X-Content-Type-Options - prevents MIME type sniffing
- ‚úÖ XSS Filter - legacy browser protection

**Configuration:**
```typescript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: { /* GraphQL-friendly directives */ },
  hsts: { maxAge: 31536000, includeSubDomains: true, preload: true },
  frameguard: { action: 'deny' },
  noSniff: true,
  xssFilter: true,
}));
```

```env
# Development (acceptable for now)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
```

**Target State:**
```env
# Production (no credentials needed!)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=relationhub-attachments-prod
NODE_ENV=production
# AWS SDK automatically uses instance metadata
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- IAM role created with least-privilege permissions
